### Project Title: Orlando's React Portfolio
The Orlando React Portfolio is a personal portfolio website created using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The website serves as a showcase for Orlando Nelson's projects, skills, and experiences as a software engineer. The portfolio includes a homepage with a brief introduction, an about me section, a resume page, a portfolio page showcasing previous projects, and a contact page. The design of the portfolio is modern and visually appealing, with a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. The portfolio was created as a personal project to showcase Orlando Nelson's skills and experiences to potential employers or clients.
